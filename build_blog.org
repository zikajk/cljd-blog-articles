*The core of this project is to:*
1. Develop a simple webpage that displays ORG files using Flutter.
2. Learn CLJD & Flutter

*Tech:*
1. ClojureDart & Flutter
   - ~org_flutter: 4.2.0~ for parsing ORG files.
2. Github for hosting articles
   - contributions and ideas are welcome!
3. [[https://www.jsdelivr.com/][jsdelivr]] for delivering resources via Github / CDN

* Lessons Learned
  1. *Utilizing ~watch~ in File Loading*
     Instead of opting for various helpers like ~FutureBuilder~, ~StreamBuilder~, or ~AnimatedBuilder~ when loading external files as strings, we can use ~:watch~ within ~f/widget.~
  2. *Stateful Widget Rerendering*
     Stateful Widgets don't automatically rerender, use ~:key~.
     [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kn0EOS-ZiIc][Video explaining the concept ]]

  3. *Addressing Non-Selectable Text in Widgets*
     Many Widgets has not selectable text by default.
     Wrap them in ~m/SelectionArea~!

See Code demonstrating points above:
#+begin_src clojure
  (f/widget
   :watch [text (services/rootBundle.loadString "resources/org/example.org")]
   :key (foundation/UniqueKey)
   (m/SelectionArea
    (org/Org text)))
#+end_src

* Work to be done
+ *Explore Slack:* Navigate through the official Slack channel for valuable insights.
+ *Organize Info:* Extract and structure the information for enhanced accessibility.
+ *Concept Articles:* Craft articles on beneficial concepts, enhancing both community knowledge and personal learning.
+ *Interactive Projects:* Develop interactive projects using CLJD and maintain a developerâ€™s journal here.
